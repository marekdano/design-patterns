/**
 * It is a behavioural design pattern that defines one-to-many dependencies 
 * between objects so that when one object (publisher) changes its state, 
 * all the other dependent objects (subscribers) are notified and updated automatically. 
 * This is also called PubSub (Publisher/Subscribers) or Event Dispatcher/Listeners Pattern. 
 * The Publisher is sometimes called Subject and the Subscribers are sometimes called Observers.
 * 
 * Chances are you are already somewhat familiar with this pattern if you have used addEventListener 
 * or jQueryâ€™s on to write event handling code. It has its influences in Reactive Programming (think RxJS) as well.
 * 
 * In the example, we create a simple Subject class that has methods to add 
 * and remove objects of Observer class from subscriber collection. 
 * Also, a fire method to propagate any changes in the Subject class object to the subscribed Observers. 
 * The Observer class, on the other hand, has its internal state and a method to update 
 * its internal state based on the change propagated from the Subject it has subscribed to.
